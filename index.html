<h2>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed a number of weaknesses in the world’s healthcare systems and in the global economy. In a new editorial a team of engineers and computer scientists argue that the current pandemic moment ought to serve as a wake-up call for society and the public health community to embrace the opportunities of robotics</br>
In the face of COVID-19, many caregivers, engineers and gifted amateurs are stepping up to find ways to support healthcare workers.</h2></br>
<h2>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the United States and the world, many are putting their hope in science to bring an end to the virus, or at least make it manageable. But it’s not just virologists and epidemiologists who will find the way forward. Researchers from all sorts of disciplines are pivoting their research to help out with the pandemic. One is John Yin, Vilas Distinguished Achievement Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at UW-Madison, who uses experimental and computational methods to understand how viruses spread. Yin is working on several projects that could have a direct bearing on COVID-19, and says he’s ramping up work on them to help combat the virus</h2>
